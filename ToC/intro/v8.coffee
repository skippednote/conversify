# # V8 JavaScript Engine
#
#V8 is Google's open source JavaScript engine. It is written in C++ and is used in Google Chrome [the open source browser from Google]. The first version of the V8 engine was released at the same time as the first version of Chrome, September 2, 2008.
#
#V8 implements ECMAScript as specified in ECMA-262, 5th edition, and runs on Windows (XP or newer), Mac OS X (10.5 or newer), and Linux systems that use IA-32, x64, or ARM processors. V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.
#
#V8 compiles JavaScript to native machine code (IA-32, x86-64, ARM, or MIPS ISAs) before executing it, instead of more traditional techniques such as executing bytecode or interpreting it. The compiled code is additionally optimized (and re-optimized) dynamically at runtime, based on heuristics of the code's execution profile. Optimization techniques used include inlining, elision of expensive runtime properties, and inline caching, among many others.
#
#V8 is intended to be used both in a browser (notably in Chrome and Chromium browsers) and as a standalone high-performance engine that can be integrated into independent projects, for example server-side JavaScript in Node.js, or client side JavaScript in .NET/Mono using V8.NET.
