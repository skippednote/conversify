# # Conversify
#
# **Conversify** is a chat web application which is able to connect hundreds of people in a realtime. The application  provides user-frienly interface. It has user authentication which makes the application secure and only those users who are logged-in can chat with each others. The application is crafted using technologies based of JavaScript.
# [Conversify]()
# Conversify is built on top of open source technologies which unlike proprietary technologies are free and easy to change or update.
#
# The most important part of the system is its realtime behaviour, i.e when one user types a message and sends it, it is automatically reflected to the other users screen without the  need of refreshing the page. Conversify other than just sending the text messages is also able to send emoticons which add to the fun part of the application.
#
# The application also provides the user functionality to delete his/her message. Everytime a user sends a message, the name is reflected with the message and a timestamp is added to it.
#
# The conversation is stored in a NoSQL database, 'MongoDB'. The users are authenticated using their Twitter accounts, which provides the name and image of the user.
