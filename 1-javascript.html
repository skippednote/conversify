          <h1 id="javascript">JavaScript</h1>
<p>JavaScript, aka Mocha, aka LiveScript, aka JScript, aka ECMAScript, is one of the world’s most popular programming languages. Virtually every personal computer in the world has at least one JavaScript interpreter installed on it and in active use. JavaScript’s popularity is due entirely to its role as the scripting language of the WWW, is one of the world’s most popular programming languages.</p>
<p>JavaScript has a syntactic similarity to Java, much as Java has to C. But it is no more a subset of Java than Java is a subset of C. It is better than Java in the applications that Java (fka Oak) was originally intended for. JavaScript was not developed at Sun Microsystems, the home of Java. JavaScript was developed at Netscape. It was originally called LiveScript, but that name wasn’t confusing enough. The -Script suffix suggests that it is not a real programming language, that a scripting language is less than a programming language. But it is really a matter of specialization. Compared to C, JavaScript trades performance for expressive power and dynamism.</p>
<h3 id="typecasting">Typecasting</h3>
<p>JavaScript was designed to run in Netscape Navigator. Its success there led to it becoming standard equipment in virtually all web browsers. JavaScript is well suited to a large class of non-Web-related applications</p>
<h3 id="moving-target">Moving Target</h3>
<p>The first versions of JavaScript were quite weak. They lacked exception handling, inner functions, band inheritance. In its present form, it is now a complete object-oriented programming language. But many opinions of the language are based on its immature forms.</p>
<p>The ECMA committee that has stewardship over the language is developing extensions which, while well intentioned, will aggravate one of the language’s biggest problems.</p>
<h3 id="object-oriented">Object Oriented</h3>
<p>JavaScript is purely Object Oriented. It has objects which can contain data and methods that act upon that data. Objects can contain other objects. It does not have classes, but it does have constructors which do what classes do, including acting as containers for class variables and methods. It does not haveclass-oriented inheritance, but it does have prototype-oriented inheritance.</p>
